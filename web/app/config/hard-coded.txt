Some parameters are hardcoded by design (such as, not possible to add parameters in annotations, ...).
But for an easier maintenance, a string has been placed close to them.

Purpose of this file is to list them with their default values for easier updates: just grep those strings within the app and you're done.

fiddle.hash_regexp = ^[a-zA-Z0-9-]{1,128}$
fiddle.max_templates = 10
